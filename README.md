Support for 170 mm print bed on Kossel Mini

The g-code provided is for a .125" pocket using a .75" bottom cleaning bit, and full cuts using a .125" end mill. You can use the .ai file to generate your own toolpaths.  Material is assumed to be .5" MDF and cuts go to .52" so you will need  a spoilboard when using this g-code.
